# Polyaxon with an introductory example


Letâ€™s look at an example of how easy you can use Polyaxon for your deep learning experiments.
This example assumes that Polyaxon is [installed](installation/introduction) and running.
And you are logged in to your Polyaxon account through the [polyaxon-cli](polyaxon_cli/commands)

1. The first step is to create a project, you can do that with the `Polyaxon-dashboard` or with the `polyaxon-cli`

```bash
$ project create --name=mnist --description='Classification of handwritten images.'
```

2. Head to your terminal and clone our [quick-start repo](https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-quick-start)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/polyaxon/polyaxon-quick-start.git
...

$ cd polyaxon-quick-start
$ ls polyaxon-quick-start

mnsit.py README.me LICENSE
```

3. Initialize the project with same name that you used when you created the project in Polyaxon

```bash
$ polyaxon init mnist --run

Polyaxonfile was created successfully `polyaxonfile.yml`
```

4. Let's open the created `polyaxon.yml` and set the minimum needed to start an experiment:

```yaml
---
version: 1

project:
  name: mnist

run:
  image: tensorflow/tensorflow:1.4.1-py3
  cmd: python mnsit.py
```

This configuration specifies:

   * the Polyaxon specification `version` we are using.
   * the `project` namespace we want to run the experiment inside.
   * The `run` section to build and execute our code, in this case we want to run our code with this tensorflow specific docker image.

5. Now let's upload our code to create a commit with on Polyaxon server

```bash
$ polyaxon upload
```

6. And start the experiment

```bash
$ polyaxon run

Experiment was created
```

7. Check your project experiments list

```bash
$ polyaxon project experiments
```

sequence | name | user | project | status | created_at
---------|------|------|---------|--------|-----------
1 | admin.cats-vs-dogs.7 | admin | admin.cats-vs-dogs | Scheduled | seconds ago


8. Check experiment logs

```bash
$ polyaxon experiment logs 1
Building --
INFO:tensorflow:global_step/sec: 1.59552
INFO:tensorflow:loss = 0.116677, step = 101 (62.679 sec)
INFO:tensorflow:global_step/sec: 1.47121
INFO:tensorflow:loss = 0.0842577, step = 201 (67.969 sec)
...
```

Congratulations! You've trained your first experiment with Polyaxon. Behind the scene a couple of things happened:

 * You upload your code, and created a git commit for this version of your code
 * You built a docker image with latest version of your code
 * You run the image with specified command you provided
 * You persisted your logs and outputs to your volume claims

To gain a deeper understanding on how polyaxon can help you iterate faster with your experiments,
familiarize yourself with the [experimentation workflow](experimentation/concepts)
