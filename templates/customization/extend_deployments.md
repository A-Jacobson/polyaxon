The helm chart used to install Polyaxon has a lot of options for you to tweak.
For a semi-complete list of the changes you can apply via your helm-chart,
see the [Polyaxon Helm Chart Configuration Reference](/reference_polyaxon_helm).


## Applying configuration changes

The general method to modify your Kubernetes deployment is to:

 1. Make a change to the config.yaml
 2. Run a helm upgrade:

    ```bash
    $ helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> polyaxon/polyaxon -f config.yaml
    ```

    Where `<RELEASE_NAME>` is the parameter you passed to `--name` when installing polyaxon with `helm install`.

    If you donâ€™t remember it, you can probably find it by doing `helm list`.

    If you used the default values suggested in the docs, the `<RELEASE_NAME>` should be `polyaxon`

  3. Wait for the upgrade to finish, and make sure that when you do
  `kubectl --namespace=<NAMESPACE> get pod` the pods are in Ready state.

    Your configuration change has been applied!
