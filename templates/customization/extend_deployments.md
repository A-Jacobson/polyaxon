The helm chart used to install Polyaxon has a lot of options for you to tweak.
For a semi-complete list of the changes you can apply via your helm-chart,
see the [Polyaxon Helm Chart Configuration Reference](/reference_polyaxon_helm).


## Applying configuration changes

The general method to modify your Kubernetes deployment is to:

 1. Make a change to the config.yaml
 2. Run a helm upgrade:

```bash
$ helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> polyaxon-chart/polyaxon -f config.yaml
```

Where <RELEASE_NAME> is the parameter you passed to --name when installing polyaxon with helm install.
If you donâ€™t remember it, you can probably find it by doing helm list.

  3. Wait for the upgrade to finish, and make sure that when you do
  `kubectl --namespace=<NAMESPACE> get pod` the hub and proxy pods are in Ready state.
  Your configuration change has been applied!
