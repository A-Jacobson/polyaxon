additionally they can access in read mode public projects from other users.


## New user creation process

The process to create a new user is the following:

 1. The new user creates an account on the Polyaxon Dashboard.
 2. The new user must contact a superuser.
 3. A superuser accept/reject the new user.
 4. Optionally the superuser grant the `superuser` mode to the new user.
