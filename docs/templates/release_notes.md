## 0.1.5

  * Build images: You can now pip install any file in your code folder without the need to call the file polyaxon_requirements.txt. Same thing if you need to build an image and have a shell script you just need to chmod +x the file and add it to the build setps.
  * Add bookmarking: You can bookmark your projects/groups/experiments/jobs/builds with Dashboard/API/CLI/Client. If your team is running too many hyper params tuning in many projects, finding the important experiments/jobs/builds can be exhausting since it requires searching each time. Bookmarks allow you to easily save important runs and have access to them in an easy way.
  * Add activity logs: shows recent create/update/delete activities in your team cluster or projects.
  * Add history/recently viewed: This is also something that some teams showed a lot of interests in having, using the platform for a couple of weeks/months and creating thousands of experiments per day, makes it very hard to access the right information.
  * Add support for external PostgreSQL: it's possible to link an external PostgreSQL database instead of the in-cluster one.
  * SSO: Add support for Microsoft Azure authentication. in addition to github, gitlab, bittbucket, and LDAP, now you can allow your team to signup/login to Polyaxon with Microsoft Azure authentication
  * Tooltips: for dates (creation date, update date, starting date, termination date) the dashboard shows a humanized version (e.g. X hours/days ago) this was not super helpful, and many users asked to have the possibility to see the exact values. On your dashboard you can see the dates values by hovering on any date and it will show datetime in the "YYYY-MM-DD HH: mm:ss" format.
  * Add docs for replication: the docs now has a section outlining different strategies for replicating Polyaxon.
  * Add docs for postgres HA strategies.
