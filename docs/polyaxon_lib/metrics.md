## MeanConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.MeanConfig(values, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, name=None)
```

Computes the (weighted) mean of the given values.

The `streaming_mean` function creates two local variables, `total` and `count`
that are used to compute the average of `values`. This average is ultimately
returned as `mean` which is an idempotent operation that simply divides
`total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric  over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `mean`.
`update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the product of `values`
and `weights`, and it increments `count` with the reduced sum of `weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __values__: A `Tensor` of arbitrary dimensions.

	- __weights__: `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `values`, and

		must be broadcastable to `values` (i.e., all dimensions must be either
		`1`, or the same as the corresponding `values` dimension).

## MeanTensorConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.MeanTensorConfig(values, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, name=None)
```

Computes the element-wise (weighted) mean of the given tensors.

In contrast to the `streaming_mean` function which returns a scalar with the
mean,  this function returns an average tensor with the same shape as the
input tensors.

The `streaming_mean_tensor` function creates two local variables,
`total_tensor` and `count_tensor` that are used to compute the average of
`values`. This average is ultimately returned as `mean` which is an idempotent
operation that simply divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric  over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `mean`.
`update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the product of `values`
and `weights`, and it increments `count` with the reduced sum of `weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __values__: A `Tensor` of arbitrary dimensions.

	- __weights__: `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as `values`, and

		must be broadcastable to `values` (i.e., all dimensions must be either

		should be added to.
	- __updates_collections__: An optional list of collections that `update_op`

		should be added to.
	- __name__: An optional variable_scope name.


- __Returns__:

  - __mean__: A float `Tensor` representing the current mean, the value of `total`

	divided by `count`.

## AccuracyConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.AccuracyConfig(input_layer=None, output_layer=None, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, name=None)
```

Calculates how often `predictions` matches `labels`.

The `streaming_accuracy` function creates two local variables, `total` and
`count` that are used to compute the frequency with which `predictions`
matches `labels`. This frequency is ultimately returned as `accuracy`: an
idempotent operation that simply divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric  over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `accuracy`.
Internally, an `is_correct` operation computes a `Tensor` with elements 1.0
where the corresponding elements of `predictions` and `labels` match and 0.0
otherwise. Then `update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the
product of `weights` and `is_correct`, and it increments `count` with the
reduced sum of `weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: The input true values layer, defaults to labels. Will

	  be cast to `bool`.
	- __output_layer__: The output layer generated by the network,

		default to last layer of the network. Will be cast to `bool`.
		If the network has multiple output, you should specify which layer to use.
	- __weights__: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as

		`labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions
		must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).

- __Raises__:

	- __ValueError__: If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if

		`weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if

## PrecisionConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.PrecisionConfig(input_layer=None, output_layer=None, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, name=None)
```

Computes the precision of the predictions with respect to the labels.

The `streaming_precision` function creates two local variables,
`true_positives` and `false_positives`, that are used to compute the
precision. This value is ultimately returned as `precision`, an idempotent
operation that simply divides `true_positives` by the sum of `true_positives`
and `false_positives`.

For estimation of the metric  over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`precision`. `update_op` weights each prediction by the corresponding value in
`weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: The input true values layer, defaults to labels. Will

	  be cast to `bool`.
	- __output_layer__: The output layer generated by the network,

## RecallConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.RecallConfig(input_layer=None, output_layer=None, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, name=None)
```

Computes the recall of the predictions with respect to the labels.

The `streaming_recall` function creates two local variables, `true_positives`
and `false_negatives`, that are used to compute the recall. This value is
ultimately returned as `recall`, an idempotent operation that simply divides
`true_positives` by the sum of `true_positives`  and `false_negatives`.

For estimation of the metric  over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` that updates these variables and returns the `recall`. `update_op`
weights each prediction by the corresponding value in `weights`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: The input true values layer, defaults to labels. Will

	  be cast to `bool`.
	- __output_layer__: The output layer generated by the network,

		default to last layer of the network. Will be cast to `bool`.

## AUCConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.AUCConfig(num_thresholds=200, curve='ROC')
```

Computes the approximate AUC via a Riemann sum.

The `streaming_auc` function creates four local variables, `true_positives`,
`true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives` that are used to
compute the AUC. To discretize the AUC curve, a linearly spaced set of
thresholds is used to compute pairs of recall and precision values. The area
under the ROC-curve is therefore computed using the height of the recall
values by the false positive rate, while the area under the PR-curve is the
computed using the height of the precision values by the recall.

This value is ultimately returned as `auc`, an idempotent operation that
computes the area under a discretized curve of precision versus recall values
(computed using the aforementioned variables). The `num_thresholds` variable
controls the degree of discretization with larger numbers of thresholds more
closely approximating the true AUC. The quality of the approximation may vary
dramatically depending on `num_thresholds`.

For best results, `predictions` should be distributed approximately uniformly
in the range [0, 1] and not peaked around 0 or 1. The quality of the AUC
approximation may be poor if this is not the case.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `auc`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: The input true values layer, defaults to labels. Will

	  be cast to `bool`.
	- __output_layer__: The output layer generated by the network,

		default to last layer of the network. Will be cast to `bool`.
		If the network has multiple output, you should specify which layer to use.
	- __weights__: Optional `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as

		`labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions
		must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
	- __num_thresholds__: The number of thresholds to use when discretizing the roc curve.

	- __metrics_collections__: An optional list of collections that `mean`

		should be added to.
	- __updates_collections__: An optional list of collections that `update_op`

		should be added to.
	- __curve__: Specifies the name of the curve to be computed, 'ROC' [default] or

		'PR' for the Precision-Recall-curve.
	- __name__: An optional variable_scope name.


- __Returns__:

  - __auc__: A scalar `Tensor` representing the current area-under-curve.

  - __update_op__: An operation that increments the `true_positives`,

	`true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives` variables
	appropriately and whose value matches `auc`.

- __Raises__:

	- __ValueError__: If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if

		`weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if
		either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.

## SpecificityAtSensitivityConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.SpecificityAtSensitivityConfig(sensitivity, num_thresholds=200)
```

Computes the specificity at a given sensitivity.

The `streaming_specificity_at_sensitivity` function creates four local
variables, `true_positives`, `true_negatives`, `false_positives` and
`false_negatives` that are used to compute the specificity at the given
sensitivity value. The threshold for the given sensitivity value is computed
and used to evaluate the corresponding specificity.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`specificity`. `update_op` increments the `true_positives`, `true_negatives`,
`false_positives` and `false_negatives` counts with the weight of each case
found in the `predictions` and `labels`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

For additional information about specificity and sensitivity, see the

## SensitivityAtSpecificityConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.SensitivityAtSpecificityConfig(specificity, num_thresholds=200)
```

Computes the specificity at a given sensitivity.

The `streaming_sensitivity_at_specificity` function creates four local
variables, `true_positives`, `true_negatives`, `false_positives` and
`false_negatives` that are used to compute the sensitivity at the given
specificity value. The threshold for the given specificity value is computed
and used to evaluate the corresponding sensitivity.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`sensitivity`. `update_op` increments the `true_positives`, `true_negatives`,
`false_positives` and `false_negatives` counts with the weight of each case
found in the `predictions` and `labels`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

## PrecisionAtThresholdsConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.PrecisionAtThresholdsConfig(thresholds)
```

Computes precision values for different `thresholds` on `predictions`.

The `streaming_precision_at_thresholds` function creates four local variables,
`true_positives`, `true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives`
for various values of thresholds. `precision[i]` is defined as the total
weight of values in `predictions` above `thresholds[i]` whose corresponding
entry in `labels` is `True`, divided by the total weight of values in
`predictions` above `thresholds[i]` (`true_positives[i] / (true_positives[i] +
false_positives[i])`).

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`precision`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

## RecallAtThresholdsConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.RecallAtThresholdsConfig(thresholds)
```

Computes various recall values for different `thresholds` on `predictions`.

The `streaming_recall_at_thresholds` function creates four local variables,
`true_positives`, `true_negatives`, `false_positives` and `false_negatives`
for various values of thresholds. `recall[i]` is defined as the total weight
of values in `predictions` above `thresholds[i]` whose corresponding entry in
`labels` is `True`, divided by the total weight of `True` values in `labels`
(`true_positives[i] / (true_positives[i] + false_negatives[i])`).

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `recall`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: The input true values layer, defaults to labels. Will

	  be cast to `bool`.
	- __output_layer__: The output layer generated by the network,

		default to last layer of the network. Will be cast to `bool`.

## SparseRecallAtKConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.SparseRecallAtKConfig(k, class_id=None)
```

Computes recall@k of the predictions with respect to sparse labels.

If `class_id` is not specified, we'll calculate recall as the ratio of true
	positives (i.e., correct predictions, items in the top `k` highest
	`predictions` that are found in the corresponding row in `labels`) to
	actual positives (the full `labels` row).
If `class_id` is specified, we calculate recall by considering only the rows
	in the batch for which `class_id` is in `labels`, and computing the
	fraction of them for which `class_id` is in the corresponding row in
	`labels`.

`streaming_sparse_recall_at_k` creates two local variables,
`true_positive_at_<k>` and `false_negative_at_<k>`, that are used to compute
the recall_at_k frequency. This frequency is ultimately returned as
- __`recall_at_<k>`__: an idempotent operation that simply divides

`true_positive_at_<k>` by total (`true_positive_at_<k>` +
`false_negative_at_<k>`).

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`recall_at_<k>`. Internally, a `top_k` operation computes a `Tensor`
indicating the top `k` `predictions`. Set operations applied to `top_k` and
`labels` calculate the true positives and false negatives weighted by
`weights`. Then `update_op` increments `true_positive_at_<k>` and
`false_negative_at_<k>` using these values.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: `int64` `Tensor` or `SparseTensor` with shape

		[D1, ... DN, num_labels], where N >= 1 and num_labels is the number of
		target classes for the associated prediction. Commonly, N=1 and `labels`
		has shape [batch_size, num_labels]. [D1, ... DN] must match `predictions`.
		Values should be in range [0, num_classes), where num_classes is the last
		dimension of `predictions`. Values outside this range always count
		towards `false_negative_at_<k>`.
	- __output_layer__: Float `Tensor` with shape [D1, ... DN, num_classes] where

		N >= 1. Commonly, N=1 and predictions has shape [batch size, num_classes].
		The final dimension contains the logit values for each class. [D1, ... DN]
		must match `labels`.
	- __k__: Integer, k for @k metric.

	- __class_id__: Integer class ID for which we want binary metrics. This should be

		in range [0, num_classes), where num_classes is the last dimension of
		`predictions`. If class_id is outside this range, the method returns NAN.
	- __weights__: `Tensor` whose rank is either 0, or n-1, where n is the rank of

		`labels`. If the latter, it must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all
		dimensions must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
	- __metrics_collections__: An optional list of collections that values should be added to.

	- __updates_collections__: An optional list of collections that updates should be added to.

	- __name__: Name of new update operation, and namespace for other dependent ops.


- __Returns__:

	- __recall__: Scalar `float64` `Tensor` with the value of `true_positives` divided

		by the sum of `true_positives` and `false_negatives`.
	- __update_op__: `Operation` that increments `true_positives` and

		`false_negatives` variables appropriately, and whose value matches `recall`.

- __Raises__:

	- __ValueError__: If `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match

	`predictions`, or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections`
	are not a list or tuple.

## SparsePrecisionAtKConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.SparsePrecisionAtKConfig(k, class_id)
```

Computes precision@k of the predictions with respect to sparse labels.

If `class_id` is not specified, we calculate precision as the ratio of true
	positives (i.e., correct predictions, items in the top `k` highest
	`predictions` that are found in the corresponding row in `labels`) to
	positives (all top `k` `predictions`).
If `class_id` is specified, we calculate precision by considering only the
	rows in the batch for which `class_id` is in the top `k` highest
	`predictions`, and computing the fraction of them for which `class_id` is
	in the corresponding row in `labels`.

We expect precision to decrease as `k` increases.

`streaming_sparse_precision_at_k` creates two local variables,
`true_positive_at_<k>` and `false_positive_at_<k>`, that are used to compute
the precision@k frequency. This frequency is ultimately returned as
- __`precision_at_<k>`__: an idempotent operation that simply divides

`true_positive_at_<k>` by total (`true_positive_at_<k>` +
`false_positive_at_<k>`).

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`precision_at_<k>`. Internally, a `top_k` operation computes a `Tensor`

## MeanAbsoluteErrorConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.MeanAbsoluteErrorConfig(input_layer=None, output_layer=None, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, name=None)
```

Computes the mean absolute error between the labels and predictions.

The `streaming_mean_absolute_error` function creates two local variables,
`total` and `count` that are used to compute the mean absolute error. This
average is weighted by `weights`, and it is ultimately returned as
- __`mean_absolute_error`__: an idempotent operation that simply divides `total` by

`count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`mean_absolute_error`. Internally, an `absolute_errors` operation computes the
absolute value of the differences between `predictions` and `labels`. Then
`update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the product of
`weights` and `absolute_errors`, and it increments `count` with the reduced
sum of `weights`

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `predictions`.

	- __output_layer__: A `Tensor` of arbitrary shape.

	- __weights__: Optional `Tensor` indicating the frequency with which an example is

Computes the mean relative error by normalizing with the given values.

The `streaming_mean_relative_error` function creates two local variables,
`total` and `count` that are used to compute the mean relative absolute error.
This average is weighted by `weights`, and it is ultimately returned as

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`mean_reative_error`. Internally, a `relative_errors` operation divides the

`normalizer`. Then `update_op` increments `total` with the reduced sum of the
product of `weights` and `relative_errors`, and it increments `count` with the

## CovarianceConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.CovarianceConfig(input_layer=None, output_layer=None, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, name=None)
```

Computes the unbiased sample covariance between `predictions` and `labels`.

The `streaming_covariance` function creates four local variables,
`comoment`, `mean_prediction`, `mean_label`, and `count`, which are used to
compute the sample covariance between predictions and labels across multiple
batches of data. The covariance is ultimately returned as an idempotent
operation that simply divides `comoment` by `count` - 1. We use `count` - 1
in order to get an unbiased estimate.

The algorithm used for this online computation is described in
- __https__://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance.

Specifically, the formula used to combine two sample comoments is
`C_AB = C_A + C_B + (E[x_A] - E[x_B]) * (E[y_A] - E[y_B]) * n_A * n_B / n_AB`
The comoment for a single batch of data is simply
`sum((x - E[x]) * (y - E[y]))`, optionally weighted.

If `weights` is not None, then it is used to compute weighted comoments,
means, and count. NOTE: these weights are treated as "frequency weights", as
opposed to "reliability weights". See discussion of the difference on
- __https__://wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Weighted_sample_variance


To facilitate the computation of covariance across multiple batches of data,
the function creates an `update_op` operation, which updates underlying
variables and returns the updated covariance.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `predictions`.

	- __output_layer__: A `Tensor` of arbitrary shape.

	- __weights__: Optional `Tensor` indicating the frequency with which an example is

		sampled. Rank must be 0, or the same rank as `labels`, and must be
		broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or
		the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
	- __metrics_collections__: An optional list of collections that

		the metric should be added to.
	- __updates_collections__: An optional list of collections that `update_op` should be added to.

	- __name__: An optional variable_scope name.


- __Returns__:

	- __covariance__: A `Tensor` representing the current unbiased sample covariance,

		`comoment` / (`count` - 1).
	- __update_op__: An operation that updates the local variables appropriately.


- __Raises__:

	- __ValueError__: If labels and predictions are of different sizes or if either

		`metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.

## PearsonCorrelationConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.PearsonCorrelationConfig(input_layer=None, output_layer=None, weights=None, metrics_collections=None, updates_collections=None, name=None)
```

Computes Pearson correlation coefficient between `predictions`, `labels`.

The `streaming_pearson_correlation` function delegates to
`streaming_covariance` the tracking of three [co]variances:

- `streaming_covariance(predictions, labels)`, i.e. covariance
- `streaming_covariance(predictions, predictions)`, i.e. variance
- `streaming_covariance(labels, labels)`, i.e. variance

The product-moment correlation ultimately returned is an idempotent operation
`cov(predictions, labels) / sqrt(var(predictions) * var(labels))`. To
facilitate correlation computation across multiple batches, the function
groups the `update_op`s of the underlying streaming_covariance and returns an
`update_op`.

If `weights` is not None, then it is used to compute a weighted correlation.
- __NOTE__: these weights are treated as "frequency weights", as opposed to

"reliability weights". See discussion of the difference on
- __https__://wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Weighted_sample_variance


- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `predictions`.

	- __output_layer__: A `Tensor` of arbitrary shape.

	- __weights__: Optional `Tensor` indicating the frequency with which an example is

		sampled. Rank must be 0, or the same rank as `labels`, and must be
		broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions must be either `1`, or
		the same as the corresponding `labels` dimension).
	- __metrics_collections__: An optional list of collections that

		the metric should be added to.
	- __updates_collections__: An optional list of collections that `update_op` should be added to.

	- __name__: An optional variable_scope name.


- __Returns__:

	- __pearson_r__: A `Tensor` representing the current Pearson product-moment

		correlation coefficient, the value of
		`cov(predictions, labels) / sqrt(var(predictions) * var(labels))`.
	- __update_op__: An operation that updates the underlying variables appropriately.


- __Raises__:

	- __ValueError__: If `labels` and `predictions` are of different sizes, or if

		`weights` is the wrong size, or if either `metrics_collections` or
		`updates_collections` are not a `list` or `tuple`.

## MeanCosineDistanceConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.MeanCosineDistanceConfig(dim)
```

Computes the cosine distance between the labels and predictions.

The `streaming_mean_cosine_distance` function creates two local variables,
`total` and `count` that are used to compute the average cosine distance
between `predictions` and `labels`. This average is weighted by `weights`,
and it is ultimately returned as `mean_distance`, which is an idempotent
operation that simply divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`mean_distance`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: A `Tensor` of the same shape as `predictions`.

	- __output_layer__: A `Tensor` of arbitrary shape.

	- __dim__: The dimension along which the cosine distance is computed.

	- __weights__: An optional `Tensor` whose shape is broadcastable to `predictions`,

		and whose dimension `dim` is 1.
	- __metrics_collections__: An optional list of collections that the metric

		value variable should be added to.
	- __updates_collections__: An optional list of collections that the metric update

		ops should be added to.
	- __name__: An optional variable_scope name.


- __Returns__:

	- __mean_distance__: A `Tensor` representing the current mean, the value of

		`total` divided by `count`.
	- __update_op__: An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables appropriately.


- __Raises__:

	- __ValueError__: If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if

		`weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if
		either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.

## PercentageLessConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.PercentageLessConfig(values, threshold)
```

Computes the percentage of values less than the given threshold.

The `streaming_percentage_less` function creates two local variables,
`total` and `count` that are used to compute the percentage of `values` that
fall below `threshold`. This rate is weighted by `weights`, and it is
ultimately returned as `percentage` which is an idempotent operation that
simply divides `total` by `count`.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the
`percentage`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __values__: A numeric `Tensor` of arbitrary size.

	- __threshold__: A scalar threshold.

	- __weights__: An optional `Tensor` whose shape is broadcastable to `values`.

	- __metrics_collections__: An optional list of collections that the metric

		value variable should be added to.
	- __updates_collections__: An optional list of collections that the metric update

		ops should be added to.
	- __name__: An optional variable_scope name.


- __Returns__:

	- __percentage__: A `Tensor` representing the current mean, the value of `total`

		divided by `count`.
	- __update_op__: An operation that increments the `total` and `count` variables appropriately.


- __Raises__:

	- __ValueError__: If `weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `values`,

		or if either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.

## MeanIOUConfig

```python
polyaxon_schemas.metrics.MeanIOUConfig(num_classes)
```

Calculate per-step mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIOU).

Mean Intersection-Over-Union is a common evaluation metric for
semantic image segmentation, which first computes the IOU for each
semantic class and then computes the average over classes.
IOU is defined as follows:
  IOU = true_positive / (true_positive + false_positive + false_negative).
The predictions are accumulated in a confusion matrix, weighted by `weights`,
and mIOU is then calculated from it.

For estimation of the metric over a stream of data, the function creates an
`update_op` operation that updates these variables and returns the `mean_iou`.

If `weights` is `None`, weights default to 1. Use weights of 0 to mask values.

- __Args__:

	- __input_layer__: A `Tensor` of ground truth labels with shape [batch size] and of

		type `int32` or `int64`. The tensor will be flattened, if its rank > 1.
	- __output_layer__: A `Tensor` of prediction results for semantic labels, whose

		shape is [batch size] and type `int32` or `int64`. The tensor will be
		flattened, if its rank > 1.
	- __num_classes__: The possible number of labels the prediction task can

		have. This value must be provided, since a confusion matrix of
		dimension = [num_classes, num_classes] will be allocated.
	- __weights__: An optional `Tensor` whose shape is broadcastable to `predictions`.

	- __metrics_collections__: An optional list of collections that `mean_iou` should be added to.

	- __updates_collections__: An optional list of collections `update_op` should be added to.

	- __name__: An optional variable_scope name.


- __Returns__:

	- __mean_iou__: A `Tensor` representing the mean intersection-over-union.

	- __update_op__: An operation that increments the confusion matrix.


- __Raises__:

	- __ValueError__: If `predictions` and `labels` have mismatched shapes, or if

		`weights` is not `None` and its shape doesn't match `predictions`, or if
		either `metrics_collections` or `updates_collections` are not a list or tuple.
